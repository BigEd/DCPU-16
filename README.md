# DCPU-16 Emulator #
This will be a web-based DCPU-16 emulator, from Mojang's new game [0x10c](http://0x10c.com/).

I am following the [spec](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt) posted by Notch.

You should be able to use the app here: [http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16](http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16).

## Progress ##
So far, this app can compile code, but it's possible there are mistakes. Testing with Notch's code comes close, but subroutines don't work properly yet (they do if you only use forward declarations). I have not yet tested this thoroughly, so if you find anything, feel free to open a ticket.

I will finish the code execution next.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
The current UI is just for getting the emulator code to work, first. I will try to make a real editor soon.
