# DCPU-16 Emulator #
This will be a web-based DCPU-16 emulator, from Mojang's new game [0x10c](http://0x10c.com/).

I am following the [spec](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt) posted by Notch.

You should be able to use the app here: [http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16](http://mappum.github.com/DCPU-16).

## Progress ##
So far, this app can compile code, but it's possible there are mistakes. Notch's example code compiles correctly. I have not yet tested this very thoroughly, so if you find anything, feel free to open a ticket.

I will finish the code execution next.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
The current UI is just for getting the emulator code to work. I will try to make a real editor soon.
